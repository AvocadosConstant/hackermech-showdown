## Overview
HACKERMECH SHOWDOWN is a 1v1 in terminal game where the goal of the game is to defeat your opponent's mech in an epic fight to send them back to the scrapyard. 

Each round, a few mech parts are selected out of a global pool of parts and made available to you. Your own mech is powered by your own strategical ingenuity and coding skills: You have ten minutes to write the JavaScript code that controls the actions of your mech.

## Build
Our front-end terminal application is written in the only real dev language, Node.js, using the [blessed](https://github.com/chjj/blessed) library.

Our back-end is powered by--you guessed it: Node.js, along with express.js, docker, and mongoDB.
